WITH THE SUM. THEY WOULD INPUT THROUGH 
POSTMAN LIKE 
OUTPUT: https://localhost:7119/input/asking/arely/3PM

PEER REVIEW: Pedro Castaneda -- Arely did a great job setting up her Endpoints. The route() is properly named. I think you should try adding validation to see if you can get the user to input the correct data type. Other than that your code is clean and you did a great job!
